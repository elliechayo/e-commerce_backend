## Description 

The objective of the project was to build the back end for an e-commerce site using the latest technologies. The task was to take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. 

Give a functional Express.js API, when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.

When I enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

When I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
